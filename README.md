# 3D-model-representation-using-3D-HOP

I created the model using photogrammetry, Agisoft Photoscan and for post-processing Blender. The artefact is from the Belgrade city Museum and Singidunum 3D project.

You can view the `HTML` file if you add ` --allow-file-access-from-files` to you Google Chrome shortcut in the `Properties - Shortcut - Target` section because it is not connected to a server.

This is just for presentation purposes and should not be used otherwise.

The other 3D models from Belgrade city Museum can be viewed at https://sketchfab.com/Singidunum3D/models.
